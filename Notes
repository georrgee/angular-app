35. Understanding Directives
1. Directives are instructions in the DOM!
    - Components are such instructions 
    - Selector: telling angular we are giving it instructors
    - Components are directives with a template
    
    For example:
    <p appTurnGreen> Green Color <\p>

    @Directive({
        Selector: '[appTurnGreen]'
    })

    export class TurnGreenDirective({
        
    })

36. ngIf
1. Syntax = *ngIf
2. structural directive
    - changes the structure of the Dom if adds or it doesnt adds

38. Styling Elements dynamically with ngStyle

* Unlike structural directives, attribute directives don't add or remove
elements. They only change the element they were placed on
