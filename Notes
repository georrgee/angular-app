35. Understanding Directives
1. Directives are instructions in the DOM!
    - Components are such instructions 
    - Selector: telling angular we are giving it instructors
    - Components are directives with a template
    
    For example:
    <p appTurnGreen> Green Color <\p>

    @Directive({
        Selector: '[appTurnGreen]'
    })

    export class TurnGreenDirective({
        
    })
